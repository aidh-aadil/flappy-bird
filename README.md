# Flappybird Pygame
Flappybird is a very popular side-scroller game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. 
I used a very popular [python](https://www.python.org/) module for making games called [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).
This is a very basic version and I took very minimal effort in building this.

- ⬆️ Use the `spacebar` key to jump. You are constantly being pulled by gravity so be careful.
- 🌳 Avoid hitting the pipes. If you do, it's game over!
